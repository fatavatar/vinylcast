# VinylCast
Cast your turntable to your google home

## Description
This project was created to make use of my google home speaker with a turntable.  It takes audio from a USB soundcard and sends it to an icecast server.  When it detects audio in the stream, it will then turn on the google speaker to stream from the icecast server.
